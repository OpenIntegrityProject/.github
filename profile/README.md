# Open Integrity: Cryptographic Trust for Git Repositories

**Open Integrity** integrates cryptographic trust mechanisms into Git repositories, enabling them to serve as cryptographic roots of trust with verifiable chains of integrity. By leveraging Git's native SSH signing capabilities and structured verification processes, Open Integrity ensures transparency, provenance, and immutability for software projects without requiring modifications to Git itself.

**Key Benefits:**

- **Immutable Proof-of-Origin** – Verify the authenticity of software artifacts
- **Signed Commits & Tags** – Ensure authorship integrity through SSH signatures (~128-bit security)
- **Tamper Detection** – Maintain verifiable repository history
- **Trust Delegation** – Enable controlled transition from inception key to authorized signers
- **Platform-Agnostic Validation** – Work across GitHub, GitLab, and self-hosted solutions
