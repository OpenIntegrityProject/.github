# Open Integrity: Cryptographic Trust for Git Repositories

**Open Integrity** integrates cryptographic trust mechanisms into Git repositories. It empowers a repo to act as a cryptographic root of trust and offer a continuing chain of trust, ensuring integrity, transparency, and accountability in software development. Open Integrity does so by leveraging Git's native SSH signing capabilities and structured verification processes. It requires no modifications to Git itself, remaining fully compatible with existing Git hosting platforms, without the need for proprietary tools or external dependencies.

**Key Benefits:**

Whether you're a developer, security researcher, or open-source maintainer, Open Integrity provides the tools to:
- Provide a **developer-friendly framework** for cryptographic integrity.
- Establish **verifiable proof-of-origin** for commits and code artifacts through direct verification by inception key holder.
- Expand that proof-of-origin through a **chain of trust** that allows delegated verification of authorized signers.
- Detect **tampering or unauthorized modifications** in repository history.
- Enable **cross-platform trust verification** across Git hosting services
