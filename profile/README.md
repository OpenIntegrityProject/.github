## 🛡 Open Integrity Project: Cryptographic Roots of Trust for Open Source Development

The **Open Integrity Project** integrates cryptographic trust mechanisms into Git repositories, enabling them to serve as cryptographic roots of trust to ensure **verifiable chains of integrity, provenance, and authorship**. By leveraging Git's native **SSH-based signing** capabilities and structured verification processes, Open Integrity ensures transparency and immutability for software projects without requiring modifications to Git itself.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- **Immutable Proof-of-Origin** – Verify the authenticity of software artifacts
- **Signed Commits & Tags** – Ensure authorship integrity through SSH signatures (~128-bit security)
- **Tamper Detection** – Maintain verifiable repository history
- **Trust Delegation** – Enable controlled transition from inception key to authorized signers
- **Platform-Agnostic Validation** – Work across GitHub, GitLab, and self-hosted solutions
